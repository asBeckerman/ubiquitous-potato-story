There once was a potato. This was the most vile and evil potato in all the land.
This potato had the power to destroy cities at will by spreading disease and 
famine to all those who refused to appease him.
One day a boy appeared before the potato to give an offering, and he noticed a weak spot on the potato...  a spud...
The boy immediately decided to hatch a plan to overthrow the potato bully. He got him and his homies together to think over something even more vile than thepotato could ever think about by himself.
