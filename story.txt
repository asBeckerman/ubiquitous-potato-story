There once was a potato. This was the most vile and evil potato in all the land.
This potato had the power to destroy cities at will by spreading disease and 
famine to all those who refused to appease him.
One day a boy appeared before the potato to give an offering, and he noticed a weak spot on the potato...  a spud...
The boy immediately decided to hatch a plan to overthrow the potato bully. He got him and his homies together to think over something even more vile than the potato could ever think about by himself.
The plan was to kill this potatoe and rid the land of his tyranny. This possible to do after discovering the newly found weak spot of the spud.
The plan went like this, one of the boys 'homies' was to diract the potatoe with a grand offering and the boy himeslf was to take advantage 
of the potatoes lack of awarness and bite off the spud, thus killing the evil potatoe.
But this potato had got some siblings. They were so sad and angry about the death of the potato and decided to take over the potato's regime and take revenge to whoever killed the potato. They had a long meeting in the ground. If you walked pass that field, you could see that a small area of soil was shaking slightly, that was because the potato's siblings were shouting angrily.
